----Beginning of setting terminal command line prompt colors----BEGINNING


#These codes set the terminal command line with my choices, colors and info.

#Setting up color choices:
orange=$(tput setaf 166);
yellow=$(tput setaf 228);
green=$(tput setaf 71);
white=$(tput setaf 15);
blue=$(tput setaf 27);
red=$(tput setaf 9);
pink=$(tput setaf 200);


#Bolding all info statements and resetting color to default within command line.
bold=$(tput bold);
reset=$(tput sgr0);

#Setting colors before each command line information that will be printed (username, host, working directory, shell, etc.)

#Bolding all outputs hereafter:
PS1="\[${bold}\]\n";


#Adding date and time at the begining and first line of prompt.
PS1+="\[${white}\]\d ";  #adding date (Day - Month - Number of month)
PS1+="\[${red}\]@ "; #changing color and adding @
PS1+="\[${white}\]\@";  #adding time (am/pm)

#Adding the FULL PATH after and in the same line with the date/time.
PS1+="\[${green}\]   \w";  #working directory PATH WITH "w" or just Current Working Directory with "W"

PS1+="\n";  #newline
#PS1+="\[${white}\]  user ";

PS1+="\[${orange}\]\u";  #username
PS1+="\[${white}\] on ";
PS1+="\[${yellow}\]\h";  #host
PS1+="\[${white}\]  shell ";
PS1+="\[${blue}\]\s" ; #Adding "shell-bash" to prompt line

#PS1+="\[${white}\]  PATH "; #IF "w" is used in the third line after this command.  Also change the 
# settings.
#OR
PS1+="\[${green}\]  WrkDir ";  #IF "W" is used in next command.
PS1+="\[${white}\]\W";  #working directory PATH WITH "w" or just Current Working Directory with "W"
#I like this setting with WrkDir best because, if I want to see PATH I can just "pwd" to see PATH.


#THESE NEXT 5 LINES DISPLAY THE GIT BRANCH WITHIN THE BASH COMMAND PROMPT LINE AND SETS ITS COLORS:
PS1+="\[${red}\]  GitBr"
parse_git_branch() {
git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'
}
PS1+="\[${red}\]\$(parse_git_branch)";



PS1+="\n";  #newline
PS1+="\[${white}\]\$ \[${reset}\]";  # '$' (and reset color)

#export PS1 - puts together all the above (PS1 and  PS1+=) lines together and CREATES your bash prompt line information and coloring.

export PS1;

#Causes python to run python3 when python is selected.
alias python=python3

#Eliminates the ZSH message on terminal bootup IF Mac preferences 
#have /bin/bash set in the USERS advanced settings.

#This sets the colors for my (ls) command and I am using a tool to get the LSCOLORS code below at this URL: 
#https://geoff.greer.fm/lscolors/

export CLICOLOR=1
export LSCOLORS=CxFxDxFAExBEGBEFABCHBH


#Sorting Directories together: The below did not work???
#ls = "ls --color=auto --group-directories-first -v -la"


#This command changes by (> character) to "Keep typing buddy ..." To make it clear what is needed - the (> character) pops us and it 
is not clear that more typing or input is required.

#This command/alias assures that my systems uses nano version 6.3 that I installed on 5-4-22:
alias nano='/usr/local/bin/nano'

#This command should cause line numbers to appear in nano edited and created files:
alias nano='nano -l'



#BELOW HERE ARE MY ALIASES ADDED AFTER 6-22-22:

#ALIAS to make lll = "ls -la | less" for a quick scroll through by page 
#of a list of full files/directories in my current directory.
alias lll='ls -lah | cat -n | less'
alias ll='ls -a'

#ALIAS - Making the remove command verbose when I remove/delete a file:
alias rm="rm -v"


#ALIAS to find details on the IP address of my MacBook Pro:
alias ip='ifconfig | less'

#ALIAS to make python run python3 when it is selected:
alias python=python3

#ALIAS to make pip run pip3 when it is selected:
alias pip=pip3
alias python3.9=python3


#ALIAS to make Xcode = Xcode11.4.1
alias Xcode=Xcode11.4.1

#ALIAS to be able to run the fillowing commands once I have apt installed:
alias uuu='sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade && sudo apt update'
alias uu='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade && sudo apt update'

#ALIAS to see if I can get grep to run ggrep with GNU grep:
alias grep='ggrep'

#Adding the PATH for JAVA_HOME:
#This command set sets JAVA_HOME so that it is recognized by apt and other applications:
#export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-18.0.2.1.jdk/Contents/Home
#Moved to .bash_profile on 9-16-22.  AND THIS WORKED IN .bash_profile
